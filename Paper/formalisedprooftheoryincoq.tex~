\title{VRAJED: Verified Reasoning About Judgements, Entailments and Deductions}
\author{Rajeev Gor\'e \and Jeremy E Dawson}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  We present a Coq formalisation for reasoning about purely syntactic derivations in a genuinely substructural setting.  By a
  suitably general abstraction of ``judgement'', we can instantiate this framework to reason about Hilbert-calculi,
  Natural-Deduction calci, Tableaux Calculi or Sequent Calculi.
