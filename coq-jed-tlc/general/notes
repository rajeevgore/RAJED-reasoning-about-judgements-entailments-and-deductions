re Polymorphic, had it used for the definitions of

general/genT.v:Polymorphic Definition rlsT W 
general/genT.v:Polymorphic Definition relationT (A : Type) 
general/gstep.v:Polymorphic Inductive runion 
general/gstep.v:Polymorphic Inductive rUnion 

deleting Polymorphic in runion and rUnion gave
File "./k4.v", line 326, characters 38-49: Error:

deleting Polymorphic in runion worked

then deleting Polymorphic in rlsT gives 
File "./ll_cam.v", line 319, characters 22-24:
Error: The reference H4 was not found in the current environment.

fixed that, then lots of similar errors

then deleting Polymorphic in relationT gives 
a few similar errors, like
File "./k4_inv.v", line 196, characters 38-39:
Error: The reference H was not found in the current environment.
