this directory is for a paper, initially planned for TABLEAUX2021,
containing writeups of the Coq proofs jeremy has done in the last year or two

later changed workplan to have all this in directory j-proofs

it was originally intended to do this in a separate branch
called j-proofs-paper but I have now decided against this,
instead doing all the work in the branch jeremy-dev
(so that one can edit writeup files and run proofs at the same time,
so they need to be in the same branch)
