proof writeup notes, started Nov 2021, based on code at that time,
(for ljt, commit 7af8c80959b2955f36654965be17c61bed0a8acf 14 May 2021)
which would run on Coq 8.11.2 

history:

original paper uses "sensible proofs"
Contraction-Free Sequent Calculi for Intuitionistic Logic,
Roy Dyckhoff, JSL 57 (1992), 795-807 

simpler version, on which my proofs are based
Contraction-Free Sequent Calculi for Intuitionistic Logic,
Roy Dyckhoff & Sara Negri, JSL 65 (2000), 1499-1518

this is a correction/simplification to the 1992 paper, not used here
Contraction-Free Sequent Calculi for Intuitionistic Logic: A Correction,
Roy Dyckhoff, JSL 83 (2018), 1680-1682

thus references to lemma numbers in what follows and the code are
to the Dyckhoff & Negri 2000 paper (D&N)

General approach:

The standard system (with rule ImpLrule shown below) is called LJ.
Dyckhoff's system is called LJT.

We defined an alternative system which we called LJA, which consists
of Dyckhoff's LJT system, omitting his left Imp-atom rule ImpL_atom_rule
and replacing it by ImpLrule_p, which is the standard ImpL rule ImpLrule,
restricted to A being an atom.
Also for LJA (as for LJ) we omit the left-exchange rule.

ImpL_atom_rule [[B; Var p]] [Imp (Var p) B; Var p]
ImpLrule [([Imp A B], A); ([B], G)] ([Imp A B], G)
ImpLrule_p [([Imp (Var p) B], Var p); ([B], G)] ([Imp (Var p) B], G)

The reason for doing the is that his ImpL_atom_rule as shown above 
(without context) has two principal formulae, which makes many of our
generally useful lemmas inapplicable. 
For example, for LJA we do not need to include left-exchange as an explicit
rule, but for LJT we do.
We discuss the other consequences of this choice later.
But then we did it all for LJT as well, so three calculi studied.

In each system we restrict the axiom rule (Idrule) to atoms.

ALSO THESE

file ljt.v: definitions, basic lemmas

PropF: formulae - constructors Var (atoms), Bot, Imp, And, Or
dnsubfml: a definition of subformula corresponding to the weight defined by D&N

dnfw, dnlw, dnsw - weights of formula, list of formulae, sequent,
noting that dnfw differs from D&N, having Bot -> 1, Var v -> 0

srseq, srseqf: the type of singleton-on-the-right sequent

LJsrrules, LJslrules: classes of rules (without context) according
to where context is added to make a rule of the system

LJTilrules, LJAilrules: some of Dyckhoff's special rules 

LJncrules, LJTSncrules, LJTncrules, LJAncrules: various sets of rules
(without left context)

LJrules, LJTSrules, LJTrules, LJArules: adding left context to the above

lemmas:
idrule_der_lj: the axiom rule (Idrule) for any formula is derivable 

Lemmas helping to prove Dyckhoff's rules are derivable 
lemmas LJ_ImpL_Or1, LJ_ImpL_Or2, LJ_ImpL_And, LJ_II

exchange admissible for LJ and LJA: exchL_lj, exchL_lja
these are easy using the lemma gen_seq.exchL_std_rule, 
which relies on the fact that each rule has at most one principal formula
on each side (so allows Idrule),
similar theorem for LJT (immediate due to exchange rule) exchL_ljt

weakening admissible for each system: LJweakening, LJAweakening, LJTweakening
and in a different form, insL_lj, insL_lja, insL_ljt
